# Notes on Variables

## Overview

- Variables use a "label" to point to data instead of using the data itself
  - What does this mean? I don't know what "label" or "point" means in context.
- Any of the 8 data types can be stored in a variable
- Similar to 'x' and 'y' in math; a simple, symbolic way to refer to data
- Difference: computer variables can store different values at different times

## Declaration

- Create or **declare** a variable with a keyword
- Naming:
  - VALID:
    - numbers
    - letters
    - $
