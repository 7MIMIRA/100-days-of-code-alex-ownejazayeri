# Levenshtein Distance

## A 50+ Year-Old Algorithm FTW

- What is Levenshtein Distance?
  - You might also know this as edit distance or the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to go from a source string to a target string.
  - While there are tons of applications for this spanning from gene sequences to spell checking, my curiosity came from 'fuzzy search' options
  - Amazingly, Levenshtein published this in 1965 and according to MIT, it's still the most efficient algorithm for doing this.
  - I can't say my implementation in JavaScript is the fastest. I'll keep working at it!
