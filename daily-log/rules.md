# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
01 March 2022

## Additional Rules
1. I'll tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode.
2. Time spent coding for work won't count towards the challenge.
3. I'll push code to GitHub every day so my progress is public.
4. I will update the [log](https://github.com/alexownejazayeri/100-days-of-code/blob/de5a1611c1e2e72295047197f378f17be6c513a7/log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link for others to see.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. Time spent on:
   - tutorials 
   - online courses 
   - other similar resources 
   - ...will NOT count towards this challenge. 


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
- Add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
- If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)

- Provide a link to a tweet if you can't push your code to GitHub.
