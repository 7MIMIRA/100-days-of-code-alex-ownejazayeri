## Day 0: 01 March 22

### Daily Log

- Worked on the React [tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial to review and take note of best practices. 
  - Key concepts: React components (subclasses, functions), managing state (passing, lifting), dynamically rendering components with functional methods like map.
- Customized #100DaysOfCode resources e.g.(hello world story, tightened up readme, resources, and log).

Next steps:
- Spruce up GitHub README.md
- Finalize best practices doc
- Review [MDN's JS refresher](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and wrestle with examples in node to firm up fundamentals

### Journal

Seung was right, the React docs are great. Excited to dive into the TypeScript docs at his recommendation too. Generally, feeling good and looking forward to putting more hours into this challenge. It feels a bit slow to start since I'm parsing through the intro stuff, but that's par for the course - gotta start somewhere!

## Day 1: 02 March 22

### Daily Log

- Rejigged 100-days-of-code repo for cleanliness; added subdirectories to organize daily logs and project work
- Spruced up my Github README.md; inspired by [Thai Braga](https://github.com/Thaiane/Thaiane).
- Solved problems on Edabit
  - Reviewed: Builtin Date object, modular arithmetic, truthiness with '!!'

Next steps:
- Refactor old FreeCodeCamp React projects
- Review the intro tutorial and parse for best practices - make a markdown doc with my own examples to firm up knowledge



### Journal

I felt pretty good today, but realized I spent almost all my time "sprucing" and not as much time writing JS & React as intended. If I'm being honest, was torn between whether or not I was bikeshedding or getting valuable experience with markdown. 

Spent most of my time revising the README.md and hello-world.md the last couple days. Even more honesty: I think I'm spending too much time trying to stand out with personality (the marketer in me) to make up for not having enough "good" code and projects.

That said, I feel good about the new repo organization with subdirectories for daily log and projects. Got a bit of JavaScript in on Edabit before wrapping up -- excited to dig into the meaty goals tomorrow now that all the "personality" is in place. The value in doing all this was to take ownership of my story and -- in full open source spirit -- live through this experience as transparently as possible for others who want to learn.

That's enough feelings for now I guess. Tomorrow's a new day!

## Day 2: 03 March 22

### Daily Log

- Spent time reviewing JS basics i.e.(var, let, const -- scoping, redeclaration, and reassignment)
- Added React intro tutorial and work in progress notes to repo

Next steps
- Refactor old FreeCodeCamp React projects
- Complete, review, and revise React 'best practices' log
- Review MDN's JS refresher and play with example in node to review

### Journal

Today wasn't as productive as I wanted it to be. Worked an 8-hour shift and had friends visiting from out of town, so minimal time between work and commuting to Oakland to get any coding done. My girlfriend is leaving for a month, so tonight was a short 20-minute sprint to play with var, let, and const via node in my terminal.

Feeling confident about the differences in scope, declaration, and assignment. Going to make up for lost time tonight tomorrow by doubling my time and then it's time to hold steady to the challenge! I really want to grow as quickly as possible to nail down a gig and do what I love for a living. This dream gets more motivating with each day in the challenge -- been having a blast, but maybe that's because I haven't dived in and really struggled with a challenging problem yet.

Note for future days.

### Journal

I stayed up really late working on this to make up for lost time. The dust is starting to shake off and I'm feeling the same sense of curiosity and wonder that hooked me on programming in the first place. Feeling good about scope, blocks, pre- and post-ES6 variable declaration and stuff, and hungry for more.

Taking a bit to ramp up, but I'm generally excited and looking forward to more of this challenge. It's still early days as I review the fundamentals, but it almost feels like now that I'm coming back from a bit of a hiatus, that I can go a level deeper than when I began to understand a bit more of what's happening under the hood of JavaScript when you're declaring variables, writing functions, thinking of scope, and so on.

Started to feel a lot better about scope, global variables and objects, and the 'this' keyword. I want to dive into the DOM and better understand how JavaScript works cross-platform (from browser to server-side js). Feels good to have a growing curiosity again!

Up next:
- Review the "under the hood" stuff e.g.(call stack, heap, execution context, javascript engine, Google V8)

### Journal

As I make through JavaScript fundamentals and brush up on the basics, I'm getting more curious about the underlying "under-the-hood" behaviors of the browser. I'm also interested in NetWorkding and reading more resources on how to write clean, readable JavaScript.

I'm happy to be spending time re-learning and firming up my JS skills, but it's definitely taken a bit to get over the hump of feeling "behind". Very cool how quickly things come back though. That's part of the beauty of programming I guess: it's logical. Sometimes things seem to behave in weird ways, but it's nice that things are sort of meant to be understood and standardized (thanks ECMA & Brandon Eich!).

Going to keep working tonight!

### Journal

Today, I was reacquainted with the beauty of JavaScript (ooh, ahh). To get a better sense of what was happening with hoisting, JS behavior around the equality of objects, and mutability of variables declared with let and const.

There's a lot to learn about what's happening under the hood, but at this early stage I think I've learned enough for a bit. I feel curious about what's happening here, but also that I'm not coding at an advanced enough level to need to know about how data is handled by JavaScript engines like Google V8, since I'm not writing super complicated projects.

Upward and onward, I'm going to continue working through the fundamentals and keep these things in mind, but not spend too much more time on them. Need to strike up a balance between theoretical and practical knowledge, but I'm sure that never goes away -- still excited and getting more energized by the day!

I can feel all the JS knowledge from before my hiatus coming back, which has actually served as a nice springboard into aiming for a deeper understanding of JS this go around.

Today I was less focused because I slept poorly last night. Feeling good, but also like I'll never be prepared enough and that's just a feeling that's going to stick around. Hope to keep working and keep a cool head through this. Can be real hard when you just want that job so bad, but best to let that passion shine through in preparation and projects. Gotta prioritize sleep and make sure not to burn out before starting.

### Journal

Today I worked on the 'Time Travel' section of React's tic-tac-toe tutorial. Felt a bit lost on this one at times, but I think it's because I'm rushing, which is problematic. That said, I'm glad that this one left exercises to the reader (see: 'MERNG' above). Felt really good to get my feet wet thinking about how to work with data between components like this. Going to take that momentum and apply it to upcoming portfolio projects!

The interview went well yesterday and today I worked loads on trying to wrap my head around GraphQL. I think I may be burning the candle at both ends this week and am going to direct all my focus into building this interview project. I feel good, but also like I'll never "know enough" in the sense that there's simply so much to be across and so much depth to this industry that I can spend and entire lifetime and still only scratch the surface. The reason software is exciting is the same reason it can be overwhelming: the learning and ideas are virtually limitless.

Fighting the overwhelm and taking things one GraphQL resolver at a time!

## Intermission

...it's 03/21 (it's technically d20 wow) and while I haven't been updating this, I've been coding non-stop.

Here's a quick update:

-  Friday March 11, I got an first-round interview with an events company. 
-  Out of sheer excitement to ace my first take-home and work with their (very cool) team, I started working tirelessly to learn GraphQL (2 #100DaysOfCode goals in 1 project, woot!)
-  Due to this bout of rapid learning, I stopped posting about my progress, but seeing as I'll continue this even after getting hired (if) - have to keep the habit up through interviews and all!

TL;DR - got busy with interviews, kept coding, didn't document and interact with the community as much.

Continuing that today and picking up on day 20 (0-indexed ofc).

### Journal

Today was my final interview for a company I'm excited about. As always, trying to temper expectations. I feel a bit off - wasn't able to sleep at all last night from interview jitters I s'pose. Anyway, the first time can always be nerve wracking but I'm glad to have gotten the experience either way.

Up next, I seriously need to fix my sleep hygiene and built a more structured routine lol. For now, I've been bingeing loads of docs and info to give the interviews at this company my all; however, it's not sustainable. I need to sprinkle in more small projects and little wins.

Knowledge is compounding and sleep dedicates knowledge to memory. It's tough right now with so much changing, but surely a routine will help give a sense of order.
