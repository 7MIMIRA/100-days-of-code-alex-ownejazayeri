## Hello world

I'm Alex, h e l l o. See that purple glory? The unpacked monitors? The mic stand, the RedBull (not glorifying this awful habit), the water (to feel less bad about the RedBull), and the headphones?

This is my workspace. 

Like many in this WFH world, I've emerged from bed every day to gently place my caboose in a chair and interact with the world almost exclusively through those screens. I don't code for a living, but I fiercely want to.

For context, early on in 2020 I took FCC's frontend certs and fell in love with programming - the endless learning, possibilities, and problem solving of it all. I used to practice math on Khan Academy in the off hours, but coding quickly filled that position - it was what I did to blow off steam at day's end. 

The more time I spent in front of those screens interacting with the digital world, the more I wanted to **build** bits of the internet and play an active role in developing it.

But again, like many of us, life threw me a load of curveballs in the last couple years. This forced me to take a hiatus from coding (you can see it on my GitHub activity).

In 2022, I decided to come back full-on with this schedule:

### 8am - 4pm 

freelance as a paid social media marketer

optimize ads across facebook, pinterest, instagram, tiktok, and snapchat 

work with cool people at a cool agency

be grateful for the opportunity, yet know I want to code instead (sigh)

### 4pm - 630pm
exercise

skate 

dread the potential of nuclear war 

dine 

consume coffee 

wish I already knew what I need to get hired 

hope coffee helps me focus 

have a lot of ~thoughts~

regret drinking coffee late in the day

etc...

*takes a deep breath* 

### ...and from 630pm to 1030pm (sometimes later)

try my darndest to self-teach programming with lots of help from friends and the internet (so much help, thank you all)

### So where did that go?

In late February, even with the support of a close friend and mentor, I felt hesitant - there was too much ground to make up. I started to rationalize moving on in exchange for the thrill of occasionally automating work tasks with Python. Then it happened...

On Valentine's Day, a Douglass Fir up in Mt. Tamalpais shed a tree-sized limb that nearly crushed me to death. The sound was so loud I immediately jolted awake to find the branch just a few feet from my tent. I didn't know how to feel: shocked, relieved, concerned? 

After processing, reality pulled back into focus...this near-death experience had reset my perspective almost instantly and reminded me that there's no sense in waiting for the "perfect" time. Good things are worth patience and persistence.

I decided to take a chance - to leave my full-time role and pursue a career as a dev. With this renewed appreciation for the brevity of life...YOLO, right? 

(sorry)

My last day is 3.14.22 (pi day, woot). While I'll miss my team and the incredible people I got to work with, I'd regret not doing this with everything I have.

Recently, I came across the #100DaysOfCode again - hard to miss when you're connected to FCC's community. After a dive into the site and seeing how active the community is, it was a no-brainer. As of 1 March 2022, I'm comitted to the rules!

As of 3.14, I'm committed to coding and applying to jobs full-time with the 'reach' goal of getting hired by the end of the challenge. 

(hire me if you want)

With tempered expecations, I'm excited to connect with and support challengers, join a community, get/give mentorship, and - if I learn enough to be valuable to someone's business - attain the holy grail: a career solving problems with computers and mostly figuring out why they don't want to listen!

Not sure if anyone will ever lay eyes on this, but if it helps you, catches your attention, inspires you, makes you cringe, or anything in between - reach out to me and tell me about it.
