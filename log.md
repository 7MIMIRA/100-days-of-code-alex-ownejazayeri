## Hello world
I'm Alex, h e l l o. See that purple glory? The unpacked monitors? The mic stand, the RedBull (not glorifying this awful habit), the water (to feel less bad about the RedBull), and the headphones?

This is my workspace. Like many in this WFH world, I've emerged from bed to gently place my caboose in a chair and interact with the world through almost strictly through screens every day for months. Early in the pandemic I took FCC's JavaScript and Frontend Libs certs, and fell in love with coding - the endless learning, possibilities, and problem solving. To relax I'd learn math on Khan Academy, but coding quickly took more of that time and started to be what I did to blow off steam at the end of a day. 

The more time I spent in front of screens - the more I wanted to **build** bits of the internet, the more I wanted to play an active role in developing it.

And again, like many of us, life threw me a load of curveballs in 2020 - 2021 and I took a long hiatus (you can see it on my GitHub activity). In 2022 I decided to come back full-on with this schedule:

8am - 4pm: freelancing as a paid social media marketer; optimizing ads across various social platforms, working with cool people at a cool agency, loving the opportunity, but knowing I want to code for a living

4pm - 630pm: exercising, skating, dreading the potential of nuclear war, dining, trying to be more helpful, consuming coffee, wishing I knew more, hoping coffee helps me focus, having a lot of ~thoughts~, etc...

*takes a deep breath* 

...and from 630pm to 1030pm (sometimes later): trying my darndest to self-teach programming with lots of help from friends and the internet (so much help, thank you all).

I got a lot of support and encouragement from a friend of mine who made this leap years ago and hasn't looked back since. After feeling intimidated by the lost progress and amount of work to make up toward the end of February, I saw a bunch of cool peeps on Twitter using the #100DaysOfCode and immediately recognized it was what I needed. Challenge accepted!

Along with the challenge I decided to take a chance - to leave my cushy full-time role and pursue a career as a dev more agressively.

My last day is 3.14 (pi day, woo!), and from then I'm comitted to coding and applying to jobs full-time with the 'reach' goal of getting hired by the end of my 100 days. Knowing it's a risk and a challenge, I'm excited to connect with and support challengers, join a community, get/give mentorship, and with tempered expecations - if I learn enough to be valuable to someone's company - attain the holy grail: a career doing what makes my heart sing!

Not sure if anyone will ever lay eyes on this, but if it helps you, catches your attention, inspires you, makes you cringe, or anything in between - reach out to me and tell me about it.
